Simple [Infrastructure As Code](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/InfrastructureAsCode.html) solution
for Java EE containers (currently only JBoss 7+) pulling from a maven repository
(currently full support only for Maven Central and Artifactory Pro, as we need to be able to search by checksum).


## Motivation

There are very good IaC solutions capable of deploying applications to and configuring resources in JEE containers.
[Ansible](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/jboss_module.html),
[Salt](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/states/all/salt.states.jboss7.html), and
[Puppet](https://forge.puppet.com/biemond/wildfly) (to name just a few) all have good support for Wildfly.
They are very powerful and can do much more than just this; they can even install the JBoss itself.
And that's exactly the problem I had: Great power comes with great responsibility.
Too much power for me as a simple developer and operator of JEE applications, working in an environment where the
platform and infrastructure is managed by dedicated operations teams.

As a JEE developer, it also takes some time and dedication to learn those tools... and even more so to add to them.
I'd rather have a very limited tool, that's easy to understand and does only what I want it to do...
living in the environment I know best: JEE.

And this simplicity also brings some security, I suppose.
A central instance that can mess with any aspect of my system is a real honey pot to any attacker.

The Deployer tries to keep away from container specifics, so the configuration files you'll write should run
on any JEE container, given that The Deployer supports it. I must admit that this is rather academic at the moment,
given that only JBoss 7+ is currently supported, but it may prove worth trying to keep extensibility in mind.


## 1-Minute-Tutorial

- Create a file `$JBOSS_CONFIG_DIR/deployer.root.bundle` containing:

```yaml
deployments:
  jolokia:
    groupId: org.jolokia
    artifact-id: jolokia-war
    version: 1.3.2
```

- Deploy the `deployer.war` to your container.
On startup, it will find your file, pull jolokia from maven central, and deploy it to the container.
If there is already a different version of jolokia deployed, it will replace it.

- Change the file to version `1.3.3` and the deployer will pick up the change and upgrade jolokia.

## Full Tutorial

You can find an introduction to the concepts and best practices [here](docs/tutorial.md).

## Reference

For a comprehensive list of all details, see [here](docs/reference.md).

## Versioning

We use [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org).

Version 1.0.0 (which was never released) provided a rest api and html gui to manage deployments by remote requests or manually on each node.
As this wasn't secure / didn't scale for many instances and stages, 2.0 was initiated.

## Building

Just run `mvn clean package`.
 
If you want to run the integration tests (`*IT`) as well, run `mvn clean install`,
but the `DeployerIT` and the `ArtifactoryRepositoryIT` require some versions of jolokia and postgresql in your local maven repository
and a checksum index file generated by the `index` command in the `ArtifactoryMockLauncher`.
They may be configured to use a real MavenCentral and/or locally running Artifactory by changing constants in the test.
