Simple [Infrastructure As Code](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/InfrastructureAsCode.html) solution
for Java EE containers (currently only JBoss 7+) pulling from a maven repository
(currently full support only for Maven Central and Artifactory Pro, as we need to be able to search by checksum).


## 1-Minute-Tutorial

- Create a file `$JBOSS_CONFIG_DIR/deployer.root.bundle` containing:

```yaml
artifacts:
  jolokia:
    groupId: org.jolokia
    artifact-id: jolokia-war
    version: 1.3.2
```

- Deploy the `deployer.war` to your container.
On startup, it will find your file, pull jolokia from maven central, and deploy it to the container.
If there is already a different version of jolokia deployed, it will replace it.

- Change the file to version `1.3.3` and the deployer will pick up the change and upgrade jolokia.

## Full Tutorial

You can find an introduction to the concepts and best practices [here](TUTORIAL.md).

## Reference

For a comprehensive list of all details, see [here](REFERENCE.md).

## History

Version 1.0.0 (which was never released) provided a rest api and html gui to manage deployments by remote requests or manually on each node.
As this wasn't secure / didn't scale for many instances and stages, 2.0 was initiated.

## Building

Just run `mvn clean package`.
 
If you want to run the integration tests (`*IT`) as well, run `mvn clean install`,
but the `DeployerIT` and the `ArtifactoryRepositoryIT` require some versions of jolokia and postgresql in your local maven repository
and a checksum index file generated by the `index` command in the `ArtifactoryMockLauncher`.
They may be configured to use a real MavenCentral and/or locally running Artifactory by changing constants in the test.
